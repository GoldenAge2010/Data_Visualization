# BOSTON CRIME DATA VISUALIZATION

Data can make a story. It can be the backbone of an investigation, and it can lead to new insights and new ways of thinking. In this project, programming language was used to process crime data based on information gathered from online, then we analyze and summarize the useful information, and finally show the result demonstrated by data visualization web tool explicitly. We have created a series of visualizations to allow understanding, exploration and analysis of data about crimes in Boston, MA. For example, the visualizations were exclusively based on mapping to show unsafe areas, this project even map the crime hotspots in Boston, as we can see from the result.  
 
Visualization of the occurrences of various crime events within different geographical areas in Boston was achieved successfully. This method considered the set of common and distinct attributes of data. The result from the approach will help build a more defined and conceptual systems that will make data be easily visualized and intelligently analyzed. The systems seemed to be clear enough to users. Therefore, we illuminate the following: 

● Provide historical data about crimes in Boston City to give the viewer an overall sense of the historical trend in various crimes. 

● Show the geographical concentrations of crimes for people in Boston, especially those visitors who are not familiar with the situation of the city. 

● Show the role of variables about crime like the longitude and latitude, time of occurrence, type, etc. 

● Provide enough choices for users in terms of the forms of visualizations that work for the users
